# Microservices Data Management

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive introduction to the concept of microservices and the associated data management challenges. It contrasts the traditional monolithic architecture with the microservices approach and delves into the critical concept of data management between services.

## Monolithic Architecture

### Definition

A **Monolithic Architecture** is a traditional way of building servers where all the code necessary for the application is housed in a single codebase and deployed as one unit.

### Request Flow

1. **Requests**: Originates from users' browsers or mobile devices.
2. **Pre-processing Middleware**: The request flows into the application, possibly through some pre-processing middleware.
3. **Routing**: Routed to the appropriate feature for processing.
4. **Database Interaction**: The feature might interact with a database to read/write data.
5. **Response**: A response is formulated and sent back to the requester.

### Characteristics

- Contains all routing, middleware, business logic, and database access code required for all features of the application.

## Transition to Microservices Architecture

### Definition

A **Microservices Architecture** is an architectural style where the application is divided into multiple smaller, self-contained services, each responsible for a specific feature of the application.

### Key Concept

Each microservice has all the code needed to implement one feature, including routing, middleware, business logic, and database access.

## Visual Comparison

### Monolithic vs. Microservices

- **Monolithic Architecture**: The application’s entire codebase is centralized and interconnected.
- **Microservices Architecture**: The application is decomposed into smaller services, each encapsulating a specific feature.

## Detailed Explanation of Microservices

### Self-contained Services

Each microservice operates independently with its own middleware, router, and even its own database. This independence ensures that if one service fails, the others continue to function, maintaining partial application availability.

### Service Independence

Example: Service A has all necessary components (middleware, router, database) to function independently of other services. The architecture promotes resilience and modularity.

## Working Definition

A **Microservice** is defined as a service that contains all the code required to make one feature work correctly, including routing, middleware, business logic, and database access.

## Data Management in Microservices

### Introduction to the Challenge

- **Common Misconception**: It's a common belief that transitioning to microservices is straightforward by simply wrapping each feature into a service. However, this is more complex in practice due to significant challenges.
- **Primary Challenge**: Data management between services, specifically how data is stored within a service and communicated between different services, is a major obstacle in microservices architecture.

### Key Concepts

1. **Data Storage in Microservices**:

   - Each microservice has its own database.
   - If a service requires a database, it gets a dedicated one.
   - No database is shared between services.
   - This pattern is known as **Database Per Service**.

2. **Data Access in Microservices**:
   - Services do not access each other’s databases.
   - A service must not directly query or manipulate the data stored in another service's database.

### Reasons for the Database Per Service Pattern

1. **Service Independence**:

   - Each service runs independently, ensuring that if one service fails, the others remain unaffected.
   - Example Scenario:
     - With a common database, if the database fails, all services depending on it will crash.
     - Scaling a single database for multiple services is challenging compared to scaling individual databases as needed.
   - If a service accesses another service's database, it introduces a dependency. If the database fails, both services are affected.

2. **Schema Changes**:

   - The structure or schema of a database might change unexpectedly, causing issues for other services relying on it.
   - Example Scenario:
     - Service A queries Database B for a user object with a "name" property.
     - If Service B’s team changes "name" to "firstName" without notifying Service A’s team, Service A will encounter errors.
   - Independent databases prevent schema changes in one service from affecting others.

3. **Database Optimization**:
   - Different services might benefit from using different types of databases.
   - Example Scenario:
     - One service might perform better with MongoDB, while another might be optimized with PostgreSQL.
   - Independent databases allow services to use the best-suited database technology for their specific needs.

### Importance of the Pattern

- **Standard Practice**: Successful engineering teams using microservices adopt the Database Per Service pattern.
- **Reliability and Efficiency**: This pattern enhances system reliability and allows for more efficient scaling and optimization.

### Challenges in Data Management

- Although the Database Per Service pattern addresses many issues, data management between services remains complex.
- Effective strategies are needed to manage and communicate data between independent services without direct database access.

## Conclusion

- **Microservices**: Each service encapsulates a specific feature with its own database, ensuring independence and resilience.
- **Database Per Service Pattern**: Critical for maintaining service independence, handling schema changes, and optimizing database performance.
- **Focus on Data Management**: The course will provide strategies to address data management challenges in microservices architecture.

By understanding and implementing these concepts, you can effectively manage data in a microservices architecture, ensuring each service operates independently and efficiently.
