# Asynchronous Communication with Event-Driven Architecture

## Overview

In this section, we explored a second form of asynchronous communication using an event-driven architecture. This pattern, although seemingly inefficient at first glance, offers various benefits in terms of service independence, performance, and scalability. The main idea behind this pattern is to have services emit events when certain actions occur, and other services consume these events to update their own databases, enabling them to respond to queries without depending directly on other services.

## Core Concept

The approach involves having a **service** (Service DX) that answers specific queries related to a user's past orders without directly querying other services. Rather than relying on synchronous calls to fetch user or product data, the service uses an **event-driven model** to receive updates about products, user creation, and orders via events emitted by other services.

### Key Steps in the Process:

1. **Service Definition**: Service DX aims to answer the query: "What products has a user with a particular ID ordered?" The goal is to show the title and image of products ordered by a specific user.

2. **Database Structure**:

   - Users collection: Records user IDs and ordered product IDs.
   - Products collection: Records product IDs with their corresponding title and image.

3. **Workflow**:

   - Whenever a product is created, a user signs up, or a user orders a product, the corresponding service (Service A, B, or C) emits an event describing what happened.
   - The event is received by an event bus, which distributes it to Service DX.
   - Service DX stores the relevant data (e.g., user ID, ordered product IDs, product title, and image) in its own database, ensuring that it can answer the query independently.

4. **Service DX Independence**:

   - Service DX has **zero direct dependencies** on other services. It can respond to requests about ordered products without relying on other services being available at the time of the request.
   - This makes Service DX resilient to the failure of other services.

5. **Asynchronous Communication**:
   - The events are emitted asynchronously, meaning Service DX does not need to wait for other services to process their requests synchronously.
   - This reduces the risk of failure due to service dependencies.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

1. **Zero Dependencies**:

   - Service DX can operate without depending directly on other services. It can respond to requests using the data stored in its own database, making it highly resilient.
   - If Services A, B, or C go down, Service DX will continue to work without issue.

2. **Improved Performance**:
   - Service DX does not need to query other services to fulfill its requests. It directly pulls data from its database, making it extremely fast and efficient.
   - The service can respond to user queries almost instantaneously without relying on other services' availability or performance.

### Cons

1. **Data Duplication**:

   - Data such as product details, user orders, and product titles/images are duplicated between the relevant services and Service DX's database.
   - Although only essential information (like title and image) is duplicated, this can still lead to additional storage costs and potential data inconsistency.

2. **Storage Costs**:

   - Storing additional data across multiple services may seem inefficient. However, in modern cloud infrastructure, the cost of storage is minimal.
   - Example: Storing 100 million product records costs approximately $14 per month, which is considered very low.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The event-driven approach introduces a higher level of complexity.
   - Implementing event emission, event handling, and managing the event bus adds overhead and requires extra code and infrastructure to maintain.
   - It can be difficult to debug and monitor, especially when the system grows in size.

## Why Choose This Pattern?

Despite the overhead and complexity introduced by this event-driven architecture, the benefits of service independence, high availability, and scalability outweigh the costs in most modern applications. This form of asynchronous communication enables services to continue functioning even when other services are down, providing a more robust and fault-tolerant architecture.

## Conclusion

This event-driven, asynchronous communication model allows Service DX to independently handle specific queries without being impacted by the availability of other services. The system is designed to be resilient, fast, and scalable. While there are trade-offs such as data duplication and increased complexity, these are manageable given the modern cloud infrastructure and the overall benefits to system performance and reliability.
